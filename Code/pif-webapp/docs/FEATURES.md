## 1. The idea in one line

You hear a 40-second story when you are physically near a place, however you got there,
and your map slowly fills in with the places you have actually been.

---

## 2. The unlock model (DECIDE)

The question: *if I'm in Mumbai, can I listen to the whole city?* Three layers answer it.
Each has its own radius.

| Layer | What it controls | Radius | Recommended rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hear** | When a story plays for the first time | the story's own `radius_m` (about 350 m) | Only when you are physically there. Never remotely. This is the product. |
| **Reveal** | Which parts of the map lose their fog | about **500 m** either side of your path | Fog clears along where you have actually travelled, in small map cells, saved on your phone. |
| **Collect** | What you can replay later | none, it's your history | A story you have heard is yours: replay it anywhere, any time. |

So the answer is **no, you can't listen to the whole city.** You hear what you pass, you
see what's around where you've been, and you keep what you've heard.

**What the map shows inside revealed areas:**
- Stories you've heard: solid pins. Tap to replay and read.
- Stories you haven't heard yet: visible but locked pins ("go there to hear it"). This
  gives a reason to take a different road home, without points or streaks.
- Outside revealed areas: fog, no pins. Nothing is spoiled.

**Alternatives considered:**
- *Whole city open:* turns it into an audio guide you browse from your sofa. Loses the point.
- *Hear only, no map memory:* simplest, but nothing accumulates, so there's little reason to open the app again.
- *Reveal radius tied to the story radius:* too small (350 m) to feel like exploring on a map.

**Open sub-questions:** should locked pins show the title, or only that *something* is
there? (Recommended: place name only, title after hearing.) Should fog be per person
only? (Yes, it never leaves the phone. No accounts, per AGENTS.md.)

## 6. Connections: who talks to whom, and over what

```
            internet (only to load the app and map tiles)
                 |
   [ phone ] ----+
     | GPS  (phone's own; the pet has no GPS)
     | Bluetooth LE  (story id, transport, display text  ->  pet;  playback, touches  <-  pet)
     v
   [ pet: ESP32-A1S ]
     | I2S         -> ES8388 codec -> headphone jack (speech) / speaker amp (chirps)
     | I2C 33/32   -> codec control
     | SPI 18/23/5/19 -> 2.4" ST7789 colour display
     | SD          -> WAV files, copied with a card reader
     | GPIO 34/36  -> capacitive touch switch (pat), button (onboard KEY1)
     | power       -> USB, or the 3.7 V Li-ion battery
```

| Link | Used for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **GPS** | Where you are | The **phone's** GPS, read by the web app. The pet has none and never gets coordinates. |
| **Bluetooth LE** | Phone ↔ pet | Ids and small messages only, never audio. Later also pet ↔ pet greeting via advertising. |
| **Wi-Fi** | Nothing on the pet | Keep it off: it competes with Bluetooth for the same radio and can cause audio clicks. Files go onto the SD card with a card reader. The phone uses mobile data or Wi-Fi only to load the app and the map. |
| **Mobile data** | Loading the app, map tiles | Stories and audio are bundled, so a journey keeps working with patchy signal once loaded. |
| **I2S** | ESP32 → codec audio | Verified working. |
| **I2C** | Codec (an IMU could join later) | SDA 33, SCL 32. Verified for the codec. |
| **SPI** | ESP32 → display | Second SPI bus, pins 18, 23, 5, 19. See section 7. |

## 7. Assembling the pet from the parts you have

**Parts in the box (2026-10-03):**

| Part | What it is | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ESP32-A1S Audio Kit v2.2 | the brain, codec, headphone jack, speaker amp, SD slot | see HARDWARE.md |
| [2.4" 240×320 TFT](https://probots.co.in/2-4-inch-240320-tft-lcd-colour-display-module-with-touch-spi-interface.html) | colour display over SPI, resistive touch, its own SD slot. The product page says ILI9341, but the group's working face code drives it as an **ST7789**, so treat it as ST7789 | replaces the round GC9A01 in HARDWARE.md and the 1.3" OLED |
| [3.7 V 950 mAh Li-ion](https://probots.co.in/lithium-ion-rechargeable-battery-3-7v-950mah-yb-503450.html) | flat cell, 50×34×5 mm, protection built in | 3-pin connector, see Power below |
| [4 Ω 3 W speaker (4070)](https://probots.co.in/rectangular-speaker-4070-4-ohm-3w-audio-driver.html) | for chirps and acknowledgements | speech still goes to the headphone jack |
| Capacitive touch switch | the "pat" pad; a self-contained module with a digital output | no ESP32 touch pin needed |
| Tactile buttons | extra inputs | |
| microSD card, wired earphones | | |

**Before soldering anything:** check which pins are actually brought out to the board's
headers (HARDWARE.md section 11 lists this as unverified). Everything below assumes the
pin is reachable.

### Display: ST7789 on the second SPI bus

The A1S already uses its first SPI-style pins for the SD card (2, 13, 14, 15). The display
goes on the ESP32's other SPI bus (VSPI), whose default pins are 18, 19, 23 and 5.

| Display pin | Wire to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VCC | 3.3 V | The module also takes 5 V. On battery, 3.3 V is what you have. |
| GND | GND | |
| SCK | GPIO **18** | |
| SDI (MOSI) | GPIO **23** | |
| CS | GPIO **5** | |
| DC (sometimes "RS") | GPIO **4** (planned) | **Tested 2026-10-04: DC on 19 does not work** (onboard KEY3's circuit sits on 19). 21 works but is the speaker amp enable, so it clashes once audio runs. Move DC to 4 before adding audio. |
| RESET | GPIO **22** (what the group wired), or the board's **EN** pin | 22 is the onboard LED pin; using it for reset is harmless (the LED blinks at boot). EN saves the pin. |
| LED (backlight) | 3.3 V | Always on to start. Later, a free pin with PWM can dim it to save battery. |
| SDO (MISO), all T_* touch pins, SD_* pins | **leave unconnected** | See below. |

- **Skip the display's resistive touch.** It needs a firm press (it's made for a stylus),
  costs two or three more pins, and the pet already has a pat pad and buttons. Skip the
  display's SD slot too; the board has its own.
- **Cost:** the common A1S docs put onboard keys KEY3 to KEY6 on 18, 19, 23 and 5. Using
  them for the display means **don't press those four onboard keys** (they would short a
  display line to ground). KEY1 (GPIO 36) stays usable. Verify on your board.
- **Firmware:** the group's face sketch uses **Adafruit_GFX + Adafruit_ST7789** and works, so keep that. Still
  avoid LVGL next to the audio pipeline. A full 240×320 frame is about 150 KB and takes
  roughly 30 ms over SPI, so during playback redraw only what changed (the progress bar,
  the text), as HARDWARE.md section 10 says.
- **Design change:** the screen is a rectangle now, not round. Use a progress bar or an arc
  instead of a progress ring around the rim. The fake pet in the app still draws a circle;
  update it when the face is designed.

### Inputs

| Part | Wire to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Capacitive touch switch VCC / GND | 3.3 V / GND | |
| Capacitive touch switch OUT | GPIO **34** | The module drives its own output, so an input-only pin is fine. This is the **pat** (and double-pat). |
| Tactile button | onboard **KEY1** (GPIO 36), or an external button wired across KEY1's contacts | GPIO 4 now goes to the display's DC. **Not 39:** the audio library uses 39 to detect headphones. 36 is input-only and KEY1 has its own pull-up. |
| Onboard KEY1 | already on GPIO 36 | A free extra button, no wiring. |

### Sound

| Part | Wire to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Speaker (4 Ω 3 W) | the board's speaker terminals | Onboard amp, enabled on GPIO 21 (untested). For chirps, not speech. |
| Earphones | the board's headphone jack | Speech. A train carriage is too loud for a small speaker. |
| microSD | the board's slot | Set DIP switches **DATA3 and CMD to ON** or the card won't mount. Files go in `/stories/<id>.wav`. |

### Power

- **Check whether your board has a battery connector** (usually a small 2-pin socket
  marked BAT near the USB port) and whether it charges from USB. Unverified on ours.
- **The battery's plug won't fit as-is.** It has a 3-pin connector (the third wire is
  usually a temperature sensor). Find + and − with a multimeter before connecting
  anything. **A reversed Li-ion cell can destroy the board.** Re-crimp or use an adapter so
  only + and − reach the board.
- **If the board has no charger,** add a TP4056 charging module with protection between
  the battery and the board.
- **Rough runtime:** the ESP32 with Bluetooth and audio plus the display backlight draws
  very roughly 150 to 250 mA, so 950 mAh gives about **3 to 5 hours**. That's an estimate;
  measure it. A dimmer backlight is the easiest saving.

### Pin budget after all of this

| Pins | Used by |
|---|---|
| 0, 25, 26, 27, 35 | audio (I2S) |
| 32, 33 | I2C to the codec |
| 2, 13, 14, 15 | SD card |
| 18, 23, 5, 4 | display (SCK, MOSI, CS, DC) |
| 19 | unusable for the display (KEY3 circuit); leave it |
| 34 | capacitive touch switch |
| 36 | button (onboard KEY1) |
| 39 | headphone detect (switches the speaker amp off when earphones go in) |
| 12 | line-in detect, and a boot strap pin |
| 36 | onboard KEY1 |
| 21 | speaker amp enable |
| 22 | onboard LED, shared with display RESET |
| 6 to 11, 16, 17 | flash and PSRAM, never usable |
| none | **No general-purpose pins left.** If you need one more, give up an onboard key you don't use (KEY1 on 36 is input-only). |

### Build and test in this order

Each step proves one thing before adding the next.
1. The display shows text and a colour fill, while the codec still answers at `0x10`.
2. Touch switch and button presses show up on the serial monitor.
3. A WAV plays from the SD card to the earphones.
4. The pet advertises over Bluetooth and nRF Connect can write `play` (PET-PROTOCOL.md).
5. Bluetooth and audio at the same time, with no stutter. This is the riskiest step.
6. The display updates during playback without clicks in the audio.
7. The web app drives it end to end.
8. Battery power, then the enclosure.
